# quicksnap-realbasic
The original REALBasic build of QuickSnap, a Mac screenshot utility

This app, originally shareware and released by me to the Mac market in 2007, is now licensed under the MIT licence, so please do with it as you wish.

I have been rewriting it in Swift for current macOS since 2018: http://github.com/joshcoventry/quicksnap/
